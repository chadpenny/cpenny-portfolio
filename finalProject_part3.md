# Changes made since Part II
After getting feedback from user research, the major changes I made were to the visualizations. I only made one change to the actual structure of the story, so I'll address this first. 
I started the story off slightly differently than I expected to. From my user research, I realized I wasn't identifying my audience until the very end of the presentation. Additionally, I never 
ended up getting access to the data about time spent outdoors overtime by demographics. So I found a different data source on how much time adults spend outside daily, and decided to narrow in on that 
and that it actually made the story flow better than what I initially planned. While this does not completely narrow down my audience, it does make the audience question whether they are part of the minority of U.S. adults 
that spend a concerningly small amount of time outside daily. 

## Design Decisions: 
My project definitely looks a lot differently than I initially pictured it. On a macro level, the whole flow changed. After part I, it was very Vitamin D heavy (actually all about Vitamin D). After Part II, I included the benefits of being outdoors and time spent outside thanks to feedback, which 
really contributed to the flow of my story. I really wanted to incorporate Pittsburgh sunlight/things to do outside in Pittsburgh, and I ended up including it at the very end of story. I think it works, but I'm still not crazy about the flow. Maybe getting user feedback on putting it at the beginning 
would have been helpful.

## Visualization Decisions: 
I changed a lot of my visualizations after Part II. First, I got rid of the word cloud that seemingly only I liked. I wanted to emphasize how many different functions Vitamin D plays. I decided just to list them out and scroll. I think there is a better way to present these different functions, but I did not get around to one. Especially since this isn't even actually data, I didn't spend too much time trying perfect it and decided to spend my time on my other visualizations.
Next, I changed my area chart to a bar chart from user feedback, and then made some minor adjustments to make it more digestible. Feedback was necessary here, as I think I was just trying to do too much, sometimes simple is better. Next up was my first graph of time spent outside. In part II, I had just used a placeholder here. For this data, since there wasn't much of it, and I just wanted to highlight a simple point, I used a donut chart. I consulted with peers and asks if it's too vanilla
and then decided to add the red "Are you here?" to draw the audience's attention to this part and really make them wonder if they are. 
On the Pittsburgh graphs,I decided to add a red rectangle to draw the audience's attention to Pittsburgh, I did this mainly because of the quick presentation, I wanted people instantly to see where Pittsburgh was on both graphs. Finally, I changed the survey data visualization on people enjoying nature. This was at first one graph with the results from 5 different questions. I didn't get any negative user feedback on the original in particular, but I personally didn't like it. I felt like it had too much
going on and distracted from the point, so I chose the 3 most applicable questions/results and made them individual charts. 

## The audience
My audience is (primarily) young adults in Pittsburgh). However, I think my audience can be broadened to any adult who answers "Yes" to the question posed at the beginning about how much time people spend outside. 
My user feedback was pretty solid on who the audience was, but in part II, I didn't really narrow it down to the end of the story. While I didn't necessarily narrow it down to young adults in Pittsburgh at the beginning of the story,
I did open up the audience to a larger population. Even if the answer to the "Are you here?" question is no, I think most people will say they probably should spend more time outside. In fact, in my user feedback, all 3 mentioned they should probably spend more time outside.

# Final thoughts
I think I spent the most time on actually looking for data. Even after Part II, just because my structure changed slightly, I needed to find additional data to include. I ended up finding and collecting way more data than I actually used, which is a good thing
because I was able to pick and choose (what I thought to be) the best. I also found that while Flourish is awesome and is the fastest way to make visualizations that look good, but it can be frustrating if it doesn't offer a particular change to the graph/viz that you'd like to make.
One way I found around this was by using the Create A Story option on Flourish. Additionally, user feedback was a lot more helpful than I had thought it would be. Because I had spent a lot of time creating the story and understanding the data, it gets easy to think that everyone else will just understand it immediately, but they won't, unless you make the story really clear!
