## Step Two: Critique 
I chose this data visualization because at first glance, it's confusing to tell what story is being told. The graph is engaging, and contains a lot of useful information, but I think the large dots everywhere and the use of three different maps makes it difficult to digest. This visualization contains the information to tell a good story and I sought to 
take that information and change the way it is portrayed. The data I used to recreate the visualization is directly from U.N. World Population Prospects 2022.


## Step Three: Original Design 
Initially, I planned on keeping the concept of using a map and use one or two maps to recreate the visualization. However, I found that using a map limited me how I could portray the data and I would have several more options if I didn't stick to the map. After exploring some visualization options, I decided to test out a bubble chart. In my first design, I discarded the data from 1990 and just used 2023 and 2050. I did this because I wanted to emphasize now and the future, with the story being the future. However, after I saw what it looked like and got feedback, I felt that it was missing a big part of the story of how we got there. My first initial sketch is below. 


## Step Four: Feedback 

### Feedback 1 (27 year old, male, graduate student):
<u>- Can you tell me what you think this is?</u><br>
This looks like a visualization to show how the world population is projected to change over the next 27 years for the largest countries/ continents in the world.

<u>- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?</u><br>
This visualization seems to show that India, China, and Africa are likely going to increase in average age and population, while others will remain more steady.

<u>- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?</u><br>
I find it surprising/confusing that the entire continent of Africa is clustered with China/ India. Clustering them together may be misleading because the countries in Africa are not necessarily collaborative the way countries in the EU are.

<u>- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?</u><br>
This is likely intended for people reading up on human geography topics such as population growth and average age, as it relates to the demographic transition within those countries. For example, high population and age are concerning for gross output, while low population and age could set the stage for large economic output over the coming years.

<u>- Is there anything you would change or do differently?</u><br>
I would add more countries, but not so many that it gets confusing. Also, find a way to highlight the change from one graph to another. Maybe a dynamic visualization that shows the bubbles grow and move over time, or a way to compare them side by side instead of trying to estimate where and how big it was in one graph vs. where and how big it is in the other. Do it for this one too.


### Feedback 2 (26 year old, male, graduate student):
<u> - Can you tell me what you think this is?</u><br>
The charts depict world populations for major countries for the years 2023 and 2050.

<u>Can you describe to me what this is telling you?</u><br>
The charts are likely geared toward depicting the changes between the current population and predicted populations for major countries in the world with larger populations. The charts also depict the average age of each country's population, so the charts are ultimately showing changes in predicted population size and average age for each major country.

<u> - Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?</u><br>
Nothing is terribly surprising about the charts but the use of color is slightly confusing. It is unclear if the different colors mean anything other than simply differentiating between countries, which if it doesn't, the color is redundant.

<u> - Who do you think is the intended audience for this?</u><br>
The intended audience for this is likely somewhat generic, as the data itself is relatively generic in its scope/focus. But I would guess the primary audience is policy makers or those in the political/government sector trying to understand how population sizes and ages affect country actions.

<u> - Is there anything you would change or do differently?</u><br>
I would include more detailed scales and perhaps a key/legend for the use of color.


Using this feedback, I created my first initial digital design, incorporating more countries, adding a dynamic component, and I added the data from 1990 to tell the whole story of progression. 
Additional Feedback:
After receiving feedback and digitally creating the first prototype of my new graph, classmates and the same person from feedback 1 gave me additional feedback which I incorporated:
1) Color coordinate by continents rather than country.
2) My graph was comparing mostly countries and then included the whole continent of Africa. While I know this is not an apples to apples comparison, I wanted to tell the story of Africa as a whole in the future. To help fix this issue,
   I added the other countries (with the exception of Asia just because the continent itself stretched the x-axis so significantly), and I added the most populuated countries of Africa to the graph.
3) I somehow shared my prototype without even realizing I left the x-axis on a logarithmic scale per the default configuration. I changed the axis to linear and set the min/max of both axes to the same values for all three graphs.

## Step 5: Final Solution
# <center> <u>An Aging World</u></center>
<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/2035453"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

I believe this to be effective in telling the story that I am trying to tell: the world is getting older, pretty much everywhere, and Africa is getting larger and staying young. I want this to make people reflect on what an older world means and why. For example, this is a good thing because it shows that life spans are rising signficantly, but are our societies equipped to handle large elderly populations? Does Africa have the systems put in place that it needs to handle such a large population? How will these older populations affect geopolitics and how will they affect the society in which we live? I wanted to show how much older the world was getting and don't think the original graphic captured that because of the color scheme. I kept the idea of population sized bubbles but just placed them over axes instead of a map. I think my visualization does a better job at showing relative ages than the original did. A few things that still bother me about this revision: the transitions amongst slides are not as smooth as they were on flourish, and the labels of the countries are all types of mismatched. Ideally, all of the labels would be uniform, however the template I was working with did not have a bold or arrow option, so those were added on manually on the story and thus aren't perfectly aligned etc.
