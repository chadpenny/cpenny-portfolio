I chose this data visualization because at first glance, it's confusing to tell what story is being told. The graph is engaging, and contains a lot of useful information, but I think the large dots everywhere and the use of three different maps makes it difficult to digest. This visualization contains the information to tell a good story and I sought to 
take that information and change the way it is portrayed. The data I used to recreate the visualization is directly from U.N. World Population Prospects 2022.
