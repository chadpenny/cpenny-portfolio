# About Me
Hello, I am part of the Army MISM-BIDA Cohort. I am in my third semester at Heinz. I have a dog named Shark who I love very much. Below is a photo of my beloved Shark on the North Shore of Oahu near Kaena Point.

# What I hope to learn
Visualization in general is one of my weaknesses. I had a lot of practice with it in my internship and improved, but I still have a long way to go and I hope this class will get me there! I look forward to improving Tableau skills and learning other visualization techniques!
