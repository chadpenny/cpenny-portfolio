## Part 1
This first graph shows only the year 2021, which contains a lot of information (Government debt as % of gdp for over 35 countries), but it doesn't tell the whole story because its only one year. It has a lot of really good features, including hovering over each country and returning the exact percentage, and it contains the overall average which is helpful. However, we are only using ~4% of the data we have, which is fine if the objective is to show just 2021. Overall, I think this chart is effective in

## Part 2
I think this graph is really effective in displaying a lot of information, however its A LOT of information. This would work in the right context, a very technical articular that is targeting very focused readers, however for most purposes, this chart is an overload of information. It has information for 42 countries from 1995-2019, which is awesome for the right purposes. But depending upon the circumstances this is used, a subset of these graphs (maybe top 5, bottom 5) would be more appropriate.

## Part 3
The thing I dislike the most about this graph is it almost feels like too many moving pieces. I considered slimming it down to just 5 countries, but figured the loss of information wasn't worth it. Additionally, I could not configure the y-axis to include a title that shows that it is a percentage. Although the title includes a subtitle explaing it as percentage, I still think it should be included on the y-axis. However, I think this graph is powerful in showing how Japan has been #1 for a long time, and how the US has risen relatively recently. I played around with the animation speed, and found this speed to most effective,
